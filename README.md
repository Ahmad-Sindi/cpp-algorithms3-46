**Algorithm Challenge – Level 3 | #46**
**Convert Line Data to Record (C++)**

🧮 Problem Description
-
This challenge demonstrates how to convert a single line of text data—commonly stored in a text document—into a structured record using C++.

The program simulates reading client data from a file, where each record is stored as a single line with a custom separator.
The line is then parsed, converted, and stored into a strongly-typed structure.

💡 What You’ll Learn
--
Splitting strings using custom delimiters

Converting raw text data into structured records

Using struct to represent real-world entities

Handling numeric conversion from strings

Designing algorithms that simulate file-based systems

Understanding data flow from documents to memory

🧩 Example
--
Input Line (from document):    

A150#//#22566#//#Hassan Ahmad#//#987643100#//#3500.500


Output:    

Account Number  : A150
PIN Code        : 22566
Name            : Hassan Ahmad
Phone Number    : 987643100
Account Balance : 3500.5


📂 File Information
--
Language: C++

File Name: convert_line_to_record.cpp

Challenge Level: 3

Challenge Number: #46

💬 Important Notes
--
This program assumes that the data is stored inside a text document.

Each developer must create their own document on their local machine.

The same logic can be extended to:

Add new records

Delete existing records

Update records

Display all records from a file

This is a foundational concept used in banking systems, inventory systems, and legacy software.
